# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

If you want specific code to execute based on the results of a true or false statement. 

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would have tried the code I found for multiples much sooner. It didn't seem like the correct code I was looking for and so I kept trying to find a different answer. 

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

I really enjoyed the challenges. I think puzzles and problem solving can be really engaging, and I enjoyed getting to learn more.
